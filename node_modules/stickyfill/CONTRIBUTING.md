# Issues and Pull Requests

This repo contains essentially a wrapper for [wilddeer/stickyfill](https://github.com/wilddeer/stickyfill).

If you're filing an issue or a sending a pull request, and it's related to the actual implementation of the library,you should probably submit it to the original repository.

If it's related to the webmodule wrapper code, this is the right place.
